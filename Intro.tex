% Sometimes "network" in biology also refers to networks of _brain areas_. See ch. 3
The phrase ``neural network'' has several meanings. A \glossary{biological neural network} is an actual set of interconnected neurons in an animal brain. Fig. \ref{introNets} (left) shows a biological neural network. ``Neural network'' can also mean \glossary{artificial neural network} (or ``ANN"),  that is, a computer model that has certain things in common with biological neural networks. Fig. \ref{introNets} (right) shows an artificial neural network. It has ``nodes'' and ``weights'', that are analogous to the neurons and synapses of a biological neural network. We focus on artificial neural networks in this book, and when we refer to ``neural networks'' we usually mean artificial neural networks.

Neural networks can be made to do many fascinating things. They can, for example, drive cars, forecast weather patterns, recognize faces in images, and play the game Go at championship levels. They have been used to model the brain at all of its levels, from individual neurons up to the entire brain. They have been used to model cognition in all of its forms, including memory, perception, categorization, language, and attention. In this chapter we give a general introduction to neural networks, and survey some of these different ways they are used. 

%Note that there are a few different ways of referring to artificial neural networks, including: ``connectionist network,'' ``PDP (parallel distributed processing) network,'' or simply ``neural network.'' These phrases differ slightly in their meaning, but will be treated as synonyms in what follows.

\section{Structure of Neural Networks}\label{structureNets}

In figure \ref{nodesWeights} a simple neural network is shown with some of its parts labeled. The network was built using Simbrain. In this section we review the parts of neural networks (nodes and weights), the way they can be structured (their topology), and the relationship between a network and its environment. 
%In each case bear in mind that what precisely the concepts mean depends on the type of model we are dealing with.\footnote{Neural networks can be designed to replicate certain biological phenomena. This is usually done to answer certain questions or model specific phenomena in \emph{neuroscience}. Models of this kind are so pervasive in modern neuroscience research that an entire field known as \emph{computational neuroscience} exists around them. Alternatively, neural networks can be very abstract: these are meant to perform computations in a general brain-like way, but are not meant to  represent a real biological neural networks. These sorts of networks are typically used for engineering applications in \emph{machine learning} and for \emph{connectionist} models in psychology. In Sect. \ref{typesOfResearch} we consider these different approaches to neural networks in more detail.}

\end{figure}

In the figure, a circle with a number in it is an artificial neuron or \glossary{node} (nodes are also referred to as ``units'').\footnote{Sometimes, when the context makes it clear that we are talking about an artificial neural network, terms like ``neuron'' and ``synapse'' are used to mean artificial neuron (i.e. node) or artificial synapse (i.e. weight).}  The number inside a circle corresponds to that node's \glossary{activation}.\footnote{In Simbrain the color of the node corresponds to its activation. Red corresponds to an ``active'' neuron (activation  greater than 0), blue corresponds to an ``inhibited'' neuron (activation less than 0), and white corresponds to an inactive neuron (activation 0). The saturation of the red or blue color also correlates with the activation (as the value gets closer to 0 the color gets less saturated).}  In a computational neuroscience model, the number might represent the firing rate of a real neuron. In a psychological model the number might represent the presence of an item in working memory. As we will see, there is a great deal of variance in what concepts like  activation mean.
% Integrate this text  and the quote (taken from the node chapter)
%In computational neuroscience, they represent real properties of neurons and synapses. For example, in some models activation represents a firing rate (number of spikes per second), and in other models it represents a voltage. Weight strength in such models represents the efficacy of a synapse in transmitting information from one neuron to another. 
%In connectionist models of psychological data, the interpretation of activation and weight strength is more abstract. Node activations are sometimes taken to represent the overall activity of a whole population of neurons in some region of the brain, something abstract like the ``strength of a hypothesis'', and they are sometimes simply taken to be hidden variables that have no biological significance whatsoever. \footnote{As McLelland, Rummelhart, and Hinton put it: ``These models assume that information processing takes place through the interactions of a large number of simple processing elements called units, each sending excitatory and inhibitory signals to other units. In some cases, the units stand for possible hypotheses about such things as the letters in a particular display or the syntactic roles of the words in a particular sentence. In these cases, the activations stand roughly for the strengths associated with the different possible hypotheses, and the interconnections among the units stand for the constraints the system knows to exist between the hypotheses. In other cases the units stand for possible goals and actions... and the connections relate goals to subgoals, subgoals to actions, and actions to muscle movements. In still other cases, units stand not for particular hypotheses or goals, but for aspects of these things'' \cite{mcclelland1986appeal}. Or again, as Sejnowski and Rosenberg say: ``The processing units in a network model share some of the properties of real neurons, but they need not be identified with processing at the level of single neurons. For example, a processing unit might be identified with a group of neurons, such as a column of neurons'' (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, p. 146) \cite{sejnowski1987parallel}.}
%  From Cohen et. al on Fear: "Processing units: Simple, nonlinear summing devices can be used as a first approximation of the behavior of populations of real neurons that redundantly code for the same piece of information."
% Perhaps the best discussion of this issues is in Smolensky PTC. (Around table 1)

The lines with filled disks at the end of them are artificial synaptic connections or \glossary{weight}s. These correspond to the connections between nodes, which control how activation flows through a network. The weights have a value, a \glossary{strength}, which is not directly visible in Simbrain, though it can be seen by hovering over the weights or double clicking on them. As activation flows through a network, the weights with a positive strength (the red weights in Simbrain) enhance activation, and the weights with a negative strength (the blue weights) reduce activation.\footnote{For more details on the graphic representation see \url{http://www.simbrain.net/Documentation/docs/Pages/Network/visualConventions.html}.} In neuroscience terms, these correspond to excitatory and inhibitory synapses. As you play with simulations in Simbrain and study the chapters to come, you will begin to get a feel for how different kinds of weights have different kinds of impacts on the flow of activation in a network. What weight strength represents again depends on what kind of model we are dealing with. In a computational neuroscience model, it would represent \glossary{synaptic efficacy}--roughly speaking the impact a pre-synaptic neuron can have on a post-synaptic neuron after the pre-synaptic neuron fires an action potential. In a connectionist or psychological model, the strength might represent an association between concepts. In a machine learning model there might be no direct interpretation of the weight strengths at all: it is merely one parameter in a statistical model that does something useful, like recognize faces in images.

Node activations change in accordance with \emph{activation rules} (discussed in ch. \extref{ch_act_functions}),  and weight strengths change in accordance with \emph{learning rules} (discussed in several chapters, including chapters \extref{ch_unsupervised} and  \extref{ch_supervised_ff}). 

In some models a nodes can also produce a \glossary{spike}, which is a discrete event that corresponds to the action potential of a neuron.\footnote{Spikes are represented in Simbrain by the node and all outgoing connections from the node turning yellow. For an illustration of a spiking node and how it looks in Simbrain, see \url{http://www.simbrain.net/Documentation/docs/Pages/Network/neuron.html}.}  Spiking neurons have their own rules and structures which we discuss in ch. \extref{ch_spiking}.

% (there is no completely standard way of visually representing neural networks; for example, compare figures \ref{iac} and \ref{emergent}). 

Nodes and weights are the basic parts of a neural network. Together, they form a network structure or mathematically, a graph\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)}.} where the nodes correspond to vertices, and the weights correspond to edges.\footnote{A neural network is a special type of graph: a vertex-labeled, edge-labeled, directed graph. This means that the edges between nodes have a direction (the graph is \emph{directed}), and that numbers are associated with the vertices and edges (it is \emph{vertex-labeled} and \emph{edge-labeled}).}  The graph-structure formed by a networks' nodes and weights is the network's \glossary{topology}. Neural network topologies fall into one of two rough types shown in Fig. \ref{nn_types}: feed-forward and recurrent. 

A  \glossary{feed-forward network} is a sequence of \emph{layers} of unconnected neurons stacked on top of each other such that each layer is fully connected to the next one in the sequence (each node in one layer sends a connection to every node in the next layer).\footnote{\label{acyclic} In graph-theoretic terms such a network is a directed, acyclic, multipartite graph. It is is \emph{acyclic} because there are no \emph{cycles}; there is is no way to ``move'' from one vertex back to itself along a sequence of vertices connected by edges. it is \emph{multi-partite} because the vertices can be partitioned in to \emph{independent sets} (layers), within which none of the vertices are connected. When such a network is not fully-connected from one layer to the next, it is still often referred to as ``feed-forward''. In some cases weights skip over a layer (e.g. go straight from input to output despite the presence of a hidden layer) and again, since activity will still flow ``forward'', this will be referred to as a feed-forward network.}  Activity in this kind of network flows from an \emph{input layer} through a (possibly empty) set of \emph{hidden layers}, and then to an \emph{output layer}.\footnote{Sometimes a distinction is made between \emph{node layers} and \emph{weight layers}. The network in Fig. \ref{nn_types} has three node layers (labelled ``input layer'', ``hidden layer'', and ``output layer'') and two weight layers (labelled ``1-2'' and ``2-1''). Depending on what someone means by ``layer'' that is a 3 (node) layer or 2 (weight) layer feed-forward network. To make matters even more confusing sometimes people don't count the input layer as a node layer. In Simbrain node and weight layers are both represented as groups, indicated by the yellow interaction boxes: \url{http://www.simbrain.net/Documentation/docs/Pages/Network/groups.html}. When used without qualification, we use the term ``layer'' to mean ``node layer''.}   In a feed-forward network activity  simply passes through; when the input nodes are activated and the network is updated, the activation flows from layer to layer and is then erased. Feed-forward networks are often classifiers: an input (which might represent an image, or a smell) passes through the layers of the network and the output activations then represent a way of classifying the input (saying who is in the image, or what object is being smelled).
%The effects of any input to the network on the network will be completely erased after $n$ iterations where $n$ is the number of layers.
% Layer to layer is bipartite, which is perhaps a more familiar term
In a \glossary{recurrent network}, the nodes are interconnected in such a way that activity can flow in repeating cycles.\footnote{In graph-theoretic terms this is a cyclic graph, which contains at least one cycle. Recall from footnote \ref{acyclic} that a directed cycle is a sequence of compatibly directed edges 
that begin and end at the same vertex.}   Recurrent networks display complex dynamical behaviors that don't occur in feed-forward networks since activity in the network cannot always ``leave'' the network. Recurrent networks are common in the brain. They can also be used to simulate dynamical processes. For example, recurrent networks can be trained to mimic human speech, or create artificial music.
%Importantly, any input to such a network merely \emph{influences} rather than dictates the network's future states which are determined by both the current input and the current state of the network (itself a product of previous inputs and/or the networks own internal dynamics).

\label{nn_types}
\end{figure}

There are other kinds of architecture beyond the ones just mentioned. An especially popular architecture since the 2010s has been the \glossary{deep network} architecture, which involves many layers of neurons and weights (some of them arranged into stacks or ``tensors'' at a given level), often using a special type of layer called a ``convolutional'' layer, which scans over its input to produce outputs. An example of a deep network is shown in figure \ref{deep_net}. Note that networks like this are so large, that we can't represent each node and weight separately. Instead node layers containing thousands of nodes (or more) and weight layers containing tens of thousands  of weights (or more)  are shown as sheets or lines. This is something we have to get used to: there are different ways of drawing neural network diagrams. We discuss deep networks more later in the book.

\label{deep_net}
\end{figure}

Networks almost always exist in some kind of  \glossary{environment}, which gathers inputs for a network and receives its outputs. For example, neural networks that convert speech to text can be connected to audio sensors, like the microphone on your computer or mobile phone. It takes audio in, converts it to text, and sends the text out. However, by far the most common way a neural network is linked to inputs and outputs, especially when building and testing them, is via tables of data. Training and testing datasets are discussed at length in chapter \extref{ch_data_science}. In Simbrain, we will also link neural networks to virtual environments. Figure \ref{nn_environment} shows how some of these configurations might look. Couplings between a network and an environment occur at special nodes:  an \glossary{input node}  is influenced by the environment, while an  \glossary{output node} exerts an influence on the environment. In figure \ref{nn_types} (left), for example, the input nodes are the nodes in the input layer, and the output nodes are the nodes in the output layer.\footnote{Information on how to couple nodes to an environment in a Simbrain simulation, and thus treat them as input or output nodes, is available here: \url{http://www.simbrain.net/Documentation/docs/Pages/Workspace/Couplings.html}.} 
%The recurrent network on the right might also have input and output nodes (or nodes that are both at once), but this is not directly visible in that figure.

\section{Computation in Neural Networks}\label{intro_comp_nn}
% What has been lost here is the contrast not just to digital computers, but to symbolic AI. See warehoused philosophyofconnectionism.txt

We've seen what the parts of a neural network are, and learned some basic concepts relating to their structure. We now turn to a concrete example in Simbrain that gives a sense of how computation works in neural networks: how they channel information, and how they can actually perform interesting tasks. We will see that a useful way of understanding computation in neural networks is by contrast with computation in a standard digital computer. 

The concepts presented in this section are illustrated in the simulation  {\em threeObjectsDist.zip} A screen shot of the network, which we call the ``three object detector'',  is shown in Fig. \ref{3ObjectClassifier}.\footnote{A video about the three object detector (including information about how to load it) is available at \url{https://youtu.be/yYzUmcPaurI?t=380}. } The three object detector has a feed-forward topology with three nodes in the input layer, seven nodes in the hidden layer, and three nodes in the output layer. The example is not meant to model the brain directly. It is more abstract:  it classifies inputs in a  brain-\emph{like} way. It takes a pattern of inputs, and transforms those inputs through a network of connections. This is similar to the way information processing occurs in the brain. But it is not a realistic simulation of a brain circuit (as we will see, it is a ``connectionist network'' as opposed to a ``computational neuroscience'' model).

In this example we also see how a network can be linked to a virtual environment. The mouse in the simulated world on the right of figure \ref{3ObjectClassifier} is hooked up to this network. When the mouse is moved around, the activation in the input nodes changes. This simulates the way odor molecules impact the inner lining of the nose, causing sensory neurons to fire at different levels. So the input layer is a kind of simulated nose. The job of this network is to distinguish the three objects on the basis of those sensory inputs. Depending on which object the mouse is near a different output node should be activated. This is called a ``classification task''.

\end{figure}
% Possibly put in Beer Categorical perception picture here for an example of mixed

We can use this example to illustrate certain  general properties of computation in neural networks, which can be contrasted with classical computation in a digital computer.\footnote{Of course, neural network simulations are usually run on a traditional computer performing classical computations. But that is a convenient way of implementing the formal structure of a neural network. These implementation can still take advantage of all the special properties of neural networks. Moreover, it is in fact possible to implement neural networks directly on hardware.} In a classical computer discrete symbols (comprised of strings of 0s and 1s or ``bits'') are operated on by rules, in a sequential manner. Bits of information are placed in registers on a computer's central processing unit (CPU), and logical rules in the CPU's instruction set are applied to these bits. Computers are hand-programmed to do useful things. The inside of a CPU and the memory systems on a computer are carefully controlled environments. They do not do well with noisy signals or damage. Computation in a neural network is  different. Neural computation is not based on sequential, rule-based operations on bits, but on parallel operations where patterns of node activations are transformed by weight strengths.\footnote{We can often represent this as a transformation of \emph{activation vectors} (lists of activation values) by \emph{weight matrices} (tables representing weight strengths). So, while the basic formalism of classical computation is logic,  the basic formalism of neural networks is \emph{linear algebra}, which we study in chapter \extref{ch_linear_algebra}.}    Neural networks are also more tolerant of noisy signals and damage than digital computers are. And they are not programmed, in the way a computer is, but are trained, in something like the way a human child is.

Let's use the three object detector simulation to consider some of these contrasts in more detail. 

First,  networks are \emph{trained}, not programmed. We show the network what we want it to do, and it learns to do it. In the three object detector, for example, here is (very roughly) what happened: we put the mouse near the fish, and said, ``when you smell something like this, fire your first node.''  Then we did the same thing with the Gouda and blue cheese. Each time we exposed the network to an object, we used the ``backprop'' algorithm (discussed in a chapter \extref{ch_supervised}) to adjust the network's weights. At first the network made mistakes, but with each exposure to an object the weights were changed a little, and over time it got better and better at recognizing cheese, in something like the way humans and animals gradually get better at doing things with training. This is called \glossary{supervised learning}, since we know the correct output for each input and can tell the network exactly what output it should produce for any given input. This isn't the only way neural networks can be trained. For example, neural networks can also learn by a system of rewards and punishments (reinforcement learning). They can also learn without any kind of training signal or reinforcement, simply by picking up on the statistical structure of their environment (\glossary{unsupervised learning}). 

Second, neural networks work in \emph{parallel}. Whereas digital computers normally do things one at a time, in a sequence, neural networks do a lot of things  \emph{at the same time}. To see the difference this can make, consider a simple problem: finding which of ten cups has a jelly bean under it. A serial approach would lift each cup up, one at a time, until the jelly bean was found. A parallel approach would lift all ten cups up at once. Neural networks operate like this, processing information in all the nodes, all at once, all the time. This is easy to see  in the three object detector simulation: when you run the simulation and drag the mouse around, the activations of all the nodes will change based on the new inputs in parallel. 
% Qualifiers about serial on a parallel computer, etc.

% Do a pass on the footnote below before re-introducing it
%\footnote{Parallel computation is clearly faster. So, why not do everything in parallel? The answer, roughly, is that the whole theory of digital computation assumes a core level of serial processing. To implement a basic algorithm assumes that things happen in a well-ordered fashion. Techniques for parallel computation exist, and are emerging as an important area of computer science, but in those cases tasks are merely broken down into sub-tasks which are each run in serial side-by-side. However not every algorithm is ammenable to this sort of decomposition (many tasks require the full evaulation of some portion of the task before another step in the task can be started) and to make matters worse the physical limitations of computer hardware as it pertains to memory management and allocation prevents even those which are ammenable from achieving peak theoretical performance. With a few (rare) exceptions 8 processing elements (PEs) working on a task in parallel will never complete a task 8x faster than a single PE for these reasons. However this sort of parallelism isn't the same kind of parallelism as what we find in living neural networks. In computer-world we have synchronous, discrete parallelism; in neuro-world we have asynchronous, continuous parallelism. A great many neurons act asynchrnously in parallel each as its own mini-PE sending and receiving signals from sensory inputs and other neurons such that what exactly each neuron is responding to or what its doing can be quite nebulous. The sorts of representation of information that the brain can support are fuzzy and fleeting, but robust. This tends to be excellent for recognizing objects, catching a fly-ball, learning to move, making analogies or being creative, but in general is poorly suited to (for instance) fast, accurate, memory-intensive numerical computation. This fuzziness is perfect for our very fuzzy world, but in the realms math and logic can be prone to mistakes. 

 %Moreover, serial computers are fast these days. For example, the computer I'm writing this on performs several billion operations per second. With numbers like those we can tolerate the processing slow-down due to serial processing.On the other hand, massively parallel processors like the brain are messy, they make mistakes. They are not as good as computers at performing, e.g., complex mathematical computations or looking up names in an index. And they are made of relatively slow materials. Neurons fire at most 200 times per second. They are orders of magnitude slower then the transistors on this computer. In order to solve problems in a reasonable time frame the brain operates in parallel: every neuron is always doing its own thing. The trade-off is in accuracy: the brain is a kind of messy computer, which doesn't always do the same thing twice. But given the wet, biological stuff we're made of, it works well enough.}

% More details on what to do in sim
Third, neural networks \emph{gracefully degrade} when they are damaged (this is also called ``fault tolerance''). They are not brittle in the way a digital computer is. You can start deleting the weights of a neural network and it will still work reasonably well. You can try doing this on the three object detector!   In a  similar way, if you lose a few neurons and /or synapses, you will be just fine. Of course, if you lose enough neurons and synapses it will start to show, but it will happen gradually and  proportionally to the damage. It is in this sense that neural networks degrade ``gracefully.''\footnote{This is related to the fact that they operate in parallel rather than serial. A neural network has lots of redundant wiring which can compensate for damage.}  A digital computer, by contrast, is not designed to continue functioning if its components are damaged. Pluck a micro-chip out of the motherboard, or snip a few wires, and there's a good chance your computer will stop working altogether. 

Fourth, neural networks are good at \emph{handling noisy inputs}. Digital computers don't like noisy input: they respond only to clean, precise inputs. Anyone who has worked with computers has some understanding of this. To get through a company's phone tree you have to enter just the right sequence of numbers--no mistakes allowed!  But show me the same flower ten times, and I will see it as the same flower, even though the input to my brain is changing slightly (the lighting changes, things in my retina change, the whole process is noisy). You can see this in the Simbrain simulation by dragging the mouse around. Notice that even while the inputs change slightly the network continues to recognize which object it's looking at.

\section{Types of Neural Network Research}\label{typesOfResearch}

In practice, neural networks are used in two main ways: (1) as engineering tools, and (2) as scientific models.
% Definition of scientific model and some reference to literature on the topic

When neural networks are used as engineering tools, they are used to do useful things, like recognize faces in photographs or convert speech to text. Neural networks used for engineering do not have to be psychologically or neurally realistic, they just have to work well. In fact, it is preferable if they are \emph{better} than humans, making fewer mistakes than we do.

Neural networks used for scientific modeling should be neurally or psychologically realistic; they should accurately describe how the brain and the mind work. A neural network model of human memory, for example, should remember (and forget) things in the same way humans do in experiments. This second use of neural networks--as models of the mind and brain--itself subdivides into several subcategories, depending on what specifically is being simulated. Neural networks are sometimes used to understand the brain (in the field of ``computational neuroscience''), sometimes to understand mind and behavior (this is sometimes called ``connectionism''), and sometimes to understand both brain and mind simultaneously.
 
\subsection{Engineering uses of neural networks}\label{machineLearning}

% Other engineering uses: 
% Fausett section 1.3
% Wiki deep  learning page

Neural networks in engineering are tools which solve problems. They are used as classifiers, controllers, signal processors and other components, alongside many other types of engineering tool. Neural networks in this area are used as statistical models (one kind of  \glossary{machine learning} model). These models are good at  finding patterns in complex and noisy data. Remember, neural networks are trained, not programmed, making them well suited to tasks where there is no obvious way to mathematically determine the relationship between a set of inputs and a set of outputs.

% As two workers in the field put it:
%\begin{quote}
%The most natural application areas for [neural networks] are obviously tasks in which appropriate transformations from certain inputs to certain outputs should be established, but the transformations cannot be discovered analytically due to a variety of reasons. Therefore it is no wonder that the most successful applications of the [neural networks] can be found in the areas of machine vision, pattern recognition, motor control, signal processing, etc., where such input to output transformations dominate the problem solving \cite{heikkonen1999building}.
%\end{quote}
%Engineers who use neural networks for these purposes don't care about how the brain works or how humans think: they want to make a machine that works. A neural-network based rice cooker (like the ``Zojirushi neuro-fuzzy rice cooker''; google it!) should make good rice, whether it cooks like humans do or not.

\end{figure}

Here is an example from the late 1990s. A lumber yard in Finland had to classify pieces of wood, identifying 30 different kinds of knot in images of lumber. Some examples are shown on the left side of figure \ref{knotNet}. A human can classify these knots, but it is time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone (look at how subtle some of the differences are between the different ``dry knots''). It is also hard to program a computer to classify these knots according to explicit rules. Thus neural networks were used, and they outperformed humans. A neural network trained on samples like the one shown have about 90\% accuracy in this process, compared with 70-80\% accuracy for humans. The neural network is shown in the figure. It is  buried inside the system, the ``MLP classifier'' towards the right (``MLP'' means ``multi-layer-perceptron,'' which is a feed-forward network trained by backpropogation. It is  similar to the 3-object detector above). This system takes a picture of a piece of wood, does some pre-processing on the resulting pixel image, and then summarizes features and colors of that image as a list of numbers, which is fed to the neural network as input. The neural network transforms these numbers into another list of numbers which describe how decayed, burnt, dry, round, and so forth each sample is. This is a \emph{feature vector}. This feature vector can then be used to classify the knot \cite{heikkonen1999building}.

\subsection{Computational neuroscience}\label{computationalNeuroscience}

\glossary{Computational neuroscience} uses computational methods to answer questions related to neuroscience. Computational neuroscience spans many levels, from the micro-scale of cell membranes to the macro-scale of the human brain as a whole (see Fig. \ref{compNeuro}). It is a highly multidisciplinary field, encompassing biology, neuroscience, psychopharmacology, cognitive science, complexity science, psychology, and even physics, depending on the context.

\emph{Micro-scale} models in computational neuroscience study individual neurons or even individual parts of neurons, like the receptors that are studded in the cell membrane to let charged particles in and out of a cell (these are models of ``receptor kinetics''). Models at this level often study the details of how charge flows through the tree like structures of a neuron's dendrites and axons, and can accurately describe the behavior or individual neurons in a laboratory dish (``in vitro'') when they are injected with current from small electrodes. Models at this level often attempt to answer questions that are physiological or pharmacological in nature like the effect of neuromodulators on the low level dynamics of a neuron, or how new receptors are created or new dendritic spines are grown. These models are largely below the level of what is visible in a single Simbrain node.

\emph{Macro-scale} models in computational neuroscience describe the behavior of large groups of thousands to millions of neurons  and the connections between them. Oftentimes these models approximate the activity of thousands of neurons or even whole brain areas as the activity of a single higher level node.\footnote{As an example, see \url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21511044} \cite{cabral2011role}}   These models can accurately describe the spatio-temporal organization of patterns of neural activity measured using brain imaging techniques like fMRI. In a Simbrain network simulation of this kind each node would represent the aggregate activity of thousands to millions of neurons and the whole network could represent the behavior of the entire brain. Models of this type are usually concerned with questions which are psychological or behavioral in nature. For instance the functional relationships between brain regions have been shown to be different in patients with schizophrenia resulting in a different overall graph structure of the functional connectivity between brain regions \cite{bullmore2009complex}. Often work at this level ``bleeds over'' into the realm of general neuroscience.

In this book we mostly focus on the \emph{meso-scale} (or ``middle''-scale) of computational neuroscience, between the micro and macro-levels. Whereas micro-scale models focus on individual neurons or their parts, meso-scale models focus on networks of \emph{hundreds to thousands} (or more) of interconnected neurons. And whereas each node in a macro-level model \emph{approximates} the activity of large group of real neurons, each of the simulated neurons in a meso-level simulation  corresponds to a real neuron. Thus, a meso-level simulation containing 1000 artificial neurons is a direct simulation of a biological neural network containing 1000 real neurons. The emphasis is on discerning governing principles and dynamical phenomena associated with these networks. Meso-level models in computational neuroscience have been implemented in Simbrain (e.g. the middle image in Fig. \ref{compNeuro}). 

The model neurons and synapses used in these simulations  are  more complex than the simple nodes and weights described above in Sect. \ref{structureNets},  since they are designed to mimic the electrochemical properties of real nerve cells. Most neuron models in computational neuroscience are governed by equations acting on variables which represent specific electrochemical attributes of living neurons. Synapses have temporal delays and their signals have duration. Network models in computational neuroscience tend to be comprised of \emph{spiking neurons} (neuron models which produce and propagate signals via action potentials) embedded in complex \emph{recurrent} networks. We cover the special properties of these model neurons and networks in chapter \extref{ch_spiking}.\footnote{In contrast to the micro-scale which is (broadly) concerned with physiology and the macro scale which is often concerned with psychology, the meso-scale concerns itself with questions like: How do networks of interconnected neurons represent information? Can we replicate synaptic connectivity using plasticity rules? How does information processing emerge from the interactions of neurons embedded in a neural network?'  Meso-scale models often attempt to understand formalisms that describe observations of groups of neurons (e.g. slices of brain tissue) with explanations of those observations using models of detailed low level processes at the micro-scale. It is known that when neurons fire in particular temporal sequences the synapses connecting them will become stronger or weaker depending upon that sequence. A micro-scale model might concern itself with how new receptors are created or new spines are grown. A meso-scale model will only concern itself with the function translating that temporal sequence into a change in synaptic strength.} 

Very roughly, the focus of computational neuroscience at these  three scales can be thought of as follows:
Neuron Dynamics $\rightarrow$ Network Dynamics $\rightarrow$ Brain Dynamics

\subsection{Connectionism}\label{connectionism}

% See Talking Nets 259, 283, 274
% Maybe talk more about semantic memory and semantic network models, and contrast with other types of memory (many will not have taken intro cog-sci courses)
The use of neural networks as cognitive models, which behave in the same way humans and animals do, but without concern for neural realism, is sometimes called \glossary{connectionism}.\footnote{Not everyone using the term ``connectionism'' in this way, but it is a fairly standard usage. A more precise phrase would be ``connectionist model of a cognitive process''.}  In connectionist models there is no direct effort to understand the brain. The focus is on modeling some aspect of human or animal behavior using nodes and weights. Such models  are usually meant to {\em suggest} how a given task is accomplished by the brain---they are ``neurally plausible''---but they do not directly model the underlying neuroscience.

As an example, consider the ``IAC'' or ``Interactive Activation and Competition'' network. A famous example is McClelland's model of knowledge of two fictional 1950s gangs, the Jets and Sharks from {\em West Side Story} \cite{mcclelland1981retrieving}.\footnote{For a video overview of this network in Simbrain, see \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw3TEDfugLs}.}

\caption[From McClelland and Rumelhart, 1989 \cite{mcclelland1989explorations}.]{A fragment of the Jets and Sharks model. Nodes in this model don't represent neural activity, but activation of concepts in semantic memory.}
\label{iac}
\end{figure}

An IAC model is organized into pools of nodes. In Fig. \ref{iac} there are 7 pools of nodes. These pools of nodes are used to model the internal concepts of a person who knows about these two gangs. The pools represent different  traits:  age, education level, marital status,  job, etc. The central ``instance nodes'', shown as black disks, correspond to individual people, and the connections represent that person's traits: their name, job, etc. The neurons in each pool inhibit each other, which produces a \emph{winner take all structure}. As the simulation runs, the activation of one node will tend to dominate the others in a pool. Notice that the topology of this network is recurrent. This is also called a \emph{spreading activation} network \cite{mcclelland1981retrieving}. 

The IAC network models general features of human semantic memory, like the ability to retrieve attributes of a person based on their name. If the Lance node is activated and the simulation is run, activation will spread through the recurrent network, and after a while the Jets node, 20s node, Junior high education node, and burglar node will have the highest activations. This is like asking ``Tell me about Lance?'' and being told about him. The network can also model our ability to describe the attributes of a group of people. If the Jets node is activated and the network is run, the standard characteristics of the Jets will light up: they tend to be in their 20s, with a junior high school education, and single. This is like asking ``Tell me about the Jets?'' and being told about that group. The network can also model our ability to identify people who match a specific description. If the 20s node and the junior-high education node are activated, then the name nodes for Lance, Jim, John, and George all light up. This is like asking ``Who is in their 20s with a junior high education?'' and being told ``Well, that could be Lance, Jim, John, or George.''
%\footnote{Notice that the nodes and connections in this model don't correspond to actual neurons or synapses. The IAC network captures the empiricist theory (associated with John Locke and David Hume) that  human knowledge is encoded in abstract associations between ideas. Node activations correspond to the presence of an item in thought or memory, or what the empiricist philosophers called \emph{ideas}. If the ``Lance'' node is active, that corresponds to a person thinking about Lance. Connections between nodes correspond to \emph{associations} between ideas. The whole network of connections represents our overall knowledge about something, in this case, two gangs. When one node  is activated and the network is run, all the associated nodes are activated. Over time all the ideas associated with the original idea should be activated \cite{mcclelland1981retrieving}. Nodes and weights represent ideas and associations in an abstract brain-like way without modeling neuroscience directly.} \cite{mcclelland1981retrieving}

\label{regularityData}
\end{figure}
 
The IAC network is a qualitative model of human memory. Other connectionist simulations are more quantitative. For example, Seidenberg and McLelland  modeled childrens' reaction times in reading words aloud. The network is a variant on a feed-forward network, similar to the network on the left side of figure \ref{nn_types}. It has  more nodes: 400 input units, which represent written words, and 460 output units, which represent spoken words. It was trained to pronounce all one-syllable words in English using a method called ``backpropogation'' (chapter \extref{ch_supervised}). This simulation models  the \emph{word frequency effect}. Words that occur frequently in language (like ``the'') are pronounced more quickly than words that occur infrequently (like ``rake'').
%\footnote{\label{exceptionsVsRegular}The model also captures the ``frequency-regularity interaction'', whereby words that have regular pronunciation patterns (e.g. ``gave'' or ``must''), are pronounced faster than exception words (e.g. ``have''  or ``pint''). However, this regularity effect only occurs for infrequent words. This is also shown in the figure: in each graph the upper curve with the open squares show exception words; the lower curves with filled triangles show regular words.}  

Human data showing this effect are on the left side of Fig. \ref{regularityData}. Humans pronounce high frequency words more quickly than  low frequency words (the $y$-axis shows latency, or length of time to pronounce the word; lower values mean faster times). The neural network data on the right  was generated by counting how many mistakes the network made for low and high frequency words \cite{seidenberg1989distributed}. When you line the two graphs up next to each other, they look the same. This suggests that the way the model reads is similar to the way humans read: both the neural network model and humans are better at reading more common words.
%\footnote{ Many questions come up here, and you might not be satisfied (in fact, this model was involved in a kind of war between connectionist and non-connectionist models of  reading). The main thing  to emphasize here is that the model is supposed to capture some kind of human, behavioral data.}

\subsection{Mixed and intermediate cases}

Both distinctions discussed in this section can be difficult to apply. It can be difficult to know whether a neural network model is being used as an engineering or a scientific model. It can also be hard to say whether a scientific model is being used to simulate the brain (computational neuroscience), or cognition and behavior (connectionism). Some models do both at once.

The first distinction, between engineering and scientific uses of neural networks, can be confusing because the two usages have been historically intertwined. Some neural networks that originated as scientific models later got used as engineering tools. Sometimes the reverse happened: an engineering tool ends up being useful as a scientific model. Deep networks provide a striking example of these back and forths. As we discuss in chapters \extref{ch_history} and  \extref{ch_neuro}, deep neural networks  were originally used as  models of vision in the 1970s. These later turned out to be excellent tools for pattern recognition, and were used to recognize digits on envelopes, leading to the deep learning revolution of the 2010s. These new and improved deep networks turned out to be useful in computational neuroscience as a way to understand the human visual system. So, a neural network that started off in science, then got used for engineering, and that tool then got adapted back to science. It's a complex and ongoing back and forth!

A good rule of thumb when considering how to classify a neural network is to ask: ``Ok, what is the neural network being used for? As a tool, or as a scientific model?''\footnote{A more advanced way to ask this question is to ask: how are the node activations and weight strengths being interpreted? Are they merely parameters in statistical models, or are they supposed to capture something real about neurons, or about concepts and their relations?} Even then it can be tricky. For example, consider the following title of a journal article: ``Use of Neural Networks in Brain SPECT to Diagnose Alzheimer's Disease'' \cite{page1996use}. At first, this sounds like it might be about a computational neuroscience or connectionist model, since it mentions the brain and Alzheimer's. However, the article is actually about how neural networks can be used to determine whether a person has Alzheimer's. The neural network is not being used as a model of the brain or any cognitive processes, but rather as an engineering tool to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease based on brain images. If we ask: ``What is the neural network they made being used for?'', the answer is to build a better diagnostic tool, \emph{not} as a model of schizophrenia. So it's really an engineering usage of a neural network, rather than a scientific model.

As far as the distinction within scientific modeling between computational neuroscience and connectionist models, here too there are difficult cases, mainly because many people who use neural network models are interested in \emph{both} how the brain works \emph{and} how cognition works, and of course, how the two are related. Thus there are increasingly many models that attempt to capture both neural and psychological data, as was noted in the discussion of macro-level computational neuroscience above. 

For example, models in \glossary{computational cognitive neuroscience} attempt to capture psychological and behavioral data while simultaneously paying attention to neural details. This type of model captures various aspects of cognition (e.g. visual attention, semantic and episodic memory, priming, familiarity, and cognitive control), using groups of neurons that are explicitly associated with specific brain circuits. Many researchers hope that over time computer models of brain and behavior will converge, and that future models will increasingly capture both neural and behavioral data, and thereby reveal how the dynamics of the brain give rise to the dynamics of cognition.\footnote{Examples of researchers and research groups working in this area include the work of Randy O'Reilly and his colleagues (\url{https://grey.colorado.edu/CompCogNeuro/index.php/CCNBook/Main}), Stephen Grossberg's work which began in the 1960s (\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Grossberg}), and the work of Chris Eliasmith and his colleagues (\url{https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-theoretical-neuroscience/people-profiles/chris-eliasmith}).} Some examples of this type of model are shown in figure \ref{ccn}.

 From this standpoint, computational neuroscience and connectionism are two ends of a continuum or spectrum. We have computational neuroscience at one end, and connectionism at the other. All through the middle of this spectrum are models that try to model both biological data and psychological data at the same time. The goal is to understand how the circuits of the brain produce all the wealth and complexity of observable human and animal behavior.
