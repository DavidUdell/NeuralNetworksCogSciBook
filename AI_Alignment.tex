\chapter{AI Alignment}\label{ch_ai_alignment}
\chapterauthor{David Udell}{1}

AI alignment is the field that is concerned with setting the goals of
artificial intelligences. The field pre-dates the deep learning revolution and
modern LLMs; it is especially interesting that much of the modern post-training
pipeline for frontier LLMs grew out of this originally speculative field, and
that AI alignment as a field has, conversely, adapted itself to the advent of
existing capable AI, in the form of modern LLMs.

\section{History}
\cite{bostrom2014superintelligence}

\section{Base Models as Pure World-Models}
% GPT-2 does not have a complete personality. It's like auto-complete on
% steroids. They will insult you and do other unusual things emulating stuff on
% the internet. Some examples of this would be great, if you could recreate
% them, or even find examples. I like the idea of making really clear what the
% “raw” personality of these is. It’s a world model, but a giant conflagration
% of personalties too. Nothing at all consistent.

\section{The LLM Post-Training Pipeline}
% So a new thing was needed, ''personality engendering'' (I guess turn-taking
% and length of responses also came out of this, right?) The helpful assistant
% persona we are used to didn’t just happen automatically. That took work. Also
% we will probably want to say something somewhere about... system prompts.

\subsection{Supervised Chat Fine-Tuning}
% Much of the work.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback}
% Interesting that it's RL on the same SSL weights.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback}
% Anthropic's
% Digression on Claude's personality
