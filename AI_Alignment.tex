AI alignment is the field that is concerned with setting the goals of
artificial intelligences. The field pre-dates the deep learning revolution and
modern LLMs; it is especially interesting that much of the modern post-training
pipeline for frontier LLMs grew out of this originally speculative field, and
that AI alignment as a field has, conversely, adapted itself to the advent of
existing powerful AI, in the form of modern LLMs.
